We want to allow people to access small amount of credits from emergent countries mainly. 


## Description 

We introduce the concept of collective loans. The collective is a group of lenders that will have a governance right to vote on who to allow to borrow money from their pool based on the shares they own on the **ERC4626 contract.** The credit delegation agreement on the vault will happen on collective based decision. Indeed, delegating credit to borrowers will be based on the groupâ€™s voting outcome (to vote, you need to have staked an amount)
